                        She is a person moved primarily by logic, as she tries not to fuss about her appearance. She may comes off as cold and apathetic, showing very little energy.
                        Despite this, she can be rigid and strict when necessary, and also has little tolerance to disobedient behavior. She was best Hero support for 5 consecutive years
                        and in 2013 took up the position of Lead Examiner and Instructor in The Hero Academy.
